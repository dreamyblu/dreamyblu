    "## Project Description\n",
    "My project is bobaBot. This is a bot used to guide a user into buying a virtual \"boba\" drink and also ask questions about it if a user is uncertain about what boba / other toppings are. This chatbot can inform users about brief information about boba toppings. The flow of a normal conversation you'd have with bobaBot would be to introduce yourself, discuss and learn more about toppings, order, and finish! I did use the code learned in A3 and modified it to fit the need of this bobaBot. I added a new function called `is_exclamation` to remind the user to lower their voice. Just because it is a robot, does not mean it does not have feelings. Feel free to start running it and chatting with it! To continue with the second part, please restart & clear output because `tea_time` makes `ascii_drawing` not work. "
