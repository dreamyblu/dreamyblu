THIS IS EXTRA.PY ! This python file has the necessary goods to help out bobaBot. I used some of the code from A3 to help guide my bot to completion. I added a new function called "is_exclamtion" to look for possible use of the "!" symbol. When executed in the bobaBot, the bot itself is aware of it and tells the user to 'lower their voice' because robots have feelings too!
